# Step: 1. Define the main function:
def main():
    pass

# Step:    - This function will be responsible for controlling the flow of the program.
def main():
    # Call the functions you want to control the flow of your program here
    function1()
    function2()
    function3()

def function1():
    # Code for function1
    pass

def function2():
    # Code for function2
    pass

def function3():
    # Code for function3
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# Step: 2. Define a helper function to check if a number is prime:
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    elif n <= 3:
        return True
    elif n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

# Step:    - This function will take a number as an argument.
def process_number(number):
    pass

# Step:    - It will start by assuming the number is prime.
is_prime = True

# Step:    - It will then check if the number is less than 2 (the smallest prime number) and if so, it will return that the number is not prime.
def check_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if check_prime(num):
    print("The number is prime.")
else:
    print("The number is not prime.")

# Step:    - It will then loop from 2 to the square root of the number, checking if the number can be divided evenly by the loop variable. If it can, it will return that the number is not prime.
def check_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

print(check_prime(10))
print(check_prime(17))

# Step:    - If the function has not returned that the number is not prime by the end of the loop, it will return that the number is prime.
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Step: 3. In the main function, loop from 2 to 100:
def main():
    for i in range(2, 101):
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# Step:    - For each number in this range, call the helper function to check if it is prime.
The code you provided seems correct and there is no syntax error. The function `is_prime(n)` checks if a number `n` is prime and then the for loop prints all prime numbers from 1 to 100. 

Here is the same code:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    elif n <= 3:
        return True
    elif n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

for num in range(1, 101):
    if is_prime(num):
        print(num)
```

If you're still getting an error, it might be due to the environment where you're running this code. Make sure you're running it in a Python environment.

# Step:    - If the helper function returns that the number is prime, print the number.
The code you've provided doesn't seem to have any syntax errors. It's a function to check if a number is prime and then a call to that function with the number 7. Here it is again for reference:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    elif n <= 3:
        return True
    elif n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

num = 7
if is_prime(num):
    print(num)
```
Please make sure to run this code in a correct Python environment. If the error persists, please provide more details about the context in which this code is being run.

# Step: 4. Call the main function to start the program.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# Step: 5. Test the program:
The code you've provided doesn't seem to have any syntax errors. It's a simple unit test for a function that adds two numbers. Here it is again:

```python
import unittest

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestAddNumbers(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_add_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(add_numbers(1, 2), 3)
        self.assertEqual(add_numbers(-1, 1), 0)
        self.assertEqual(add_numbers(-1, -1), -2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

If you're getting a syntax error, it might be due to the way you're running the script. Make sure to save this code in a .py file and run it using a Python interpreter.

# Step:    - Run the program and verify that it correctly prints all prime numbers up to 100.
for num in range(2, 101):
    prime = True
    for i in range(2, num):
        if (num%i==0):
            prime = False
    if prime:
       print(num)

# Step:    - Try changing the range to test if the program correctly identifies prime numbers up to other limits.
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

for i in range(1, 101):  # Change the range here to test for other limits
    if is_prime(i):
        print(i)

# Step:    - Verify that the program correctly identifies 2 as a prime number, as it is the only even prime number.
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and n > 2): 
        return False
    return all(n % i for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2))

print(is_prime(2))

# Step:    - Verify that the program does not identify 1 as a prime number, as 1 is not considered to be prime.
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and n > 2): 
        return False
    return all(n % i for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2))

print(is_prime(1))

# Step: 6. Debug and finalize the program:
As an AI model, I'm sorry but you haven't provided any code to debug. Please provide the code you're having issues with so I can assist you.

# Step:    - If any issues are found during testing, debug the program to fix these issues.
The error message you provided does not seem to match the code you've given. The code you've provided would raise a TypeError because you're trying to add an integer and a string. However, the error message you've provided suggests there's an unterminated string literal, which is not present in the provided code.

If the error is indeed a TypeError, the fix would be to ensure that the arguments passed to the buggy_function are of the same type. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import pdb

def buggy_function(arg1, arg2):
    # Some buggy code here
    result = arg1 + arg2  # Let's assume this is a bug
    return result

def main():
    try:
        buggy_function(1, 2)  # This will not raise a TypeError
    except Exception as e:
        pdb.set_trace()  # This will start the debugger at the point of the exception

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

If the error is an unterminated string literal, you would need to provide the correct code that caused this error for me to help you fix it.

# Step:    - Once the program is working correctly, finalize it and prepare it for deployment or submission.
# Python code
def main():
    pass  # Your main program code here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
